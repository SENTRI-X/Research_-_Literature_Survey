The PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor module, commonly known as the HC-SR501, is a widely used motion detector that senses changes in infrared radiation emitted by moving objects, primarily humans or animals.
 It operates using a pyroelectric sensor combined with a Fresnel lens to detect motion within its field of view.
 The module outputs a digital signal, going HIGH (3.3V) when motion is detected and LOW (0V) afterward, with the duration of the HIGH signal adjustable via a potentiometer.

Key specifications include an operating voltage range of 4.5V to 20V DC 
 , a detection range adjustable from 3 to 7 meters 
 , and a detection angle of up to 120°.
 The delay time before the output returns to LOW can be set between 0.3 seconds and 200 seconds (or up to 10 minutes, depending on the model).
 A blocking time of approximately 2.5 seconds prevents the sensor from re-triggering immediately after the initial detection.
 The sensor features two trigger modes: a single trigger mode (L) where the output stays HIGH for the set delay and ignores further motion, and a repeatable trigger mode (H) where each new motion resets the delay timer.

The module is designed for low power consumption, with an idle current of less than 50 µA 
 , making it suitable for battery-powered applications.
 It is compatible with various microcontrollers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, often used in applications such as security systems, home automation (e.g., automatic lighting), robotics, and energy-saving systems.
 The sensor is typically housed in a compact 32 x 24 mm module with mounting holes for easy installation. 


 An IR sensor module is an electronic device designed to detect infrared (IR) radiation, commonly used for applications like obstacle detection, remote control signal reception, and motion sensing. These modules typically consist of an IR transmitter (an IR LED) and an IR receiver (a photodiode or phototransistor), which work together to detect the presence of objects or signals.
 The IR LED emits infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye, with wavelengths typically ranging from 700 nm to 1 mm.
 When this light hits an object, it reflects back to the receiver, allowing the module to detect the object's presence.

The module often includes additional components for signal processing, such as an operational amplifier (Op-amp) to amplify the received signal, a comparator (like the LM393) to convert the analog signal into a digital output, and a variable resistor (trimmer potentiometer) to adjust the detection sensitivity and range.
 The output is usually digital, providing a logic HIGH or LOW signal based on whether an object is detected or not.
 Some modules also feature indicator LEDs: a power LED that turns on when the module is powered, and a signal LED that lights up when an object is detected.

IR sensor modules are widely used in various applications. Active IR sensors, which emit their own IR light, are used for proximity sensing, obstacle avoidance in robots, and object detection.
 For example, they are commonly found in smart cars and robotic systems to prevent collisions.
 Passive IR sensors, which detect infrared radiation emitted by objects (like body heat), are used in motion detection systems.
 Another major application is in remote control systems, where the module receives modulated IR signals, typically at a frequency of 38 kHz, from devices like TV remotes.
 These signals are often pulsed to create coded messages, and the receiver module detects these pulses, outputting a corresponding low signal when a command is received.

The modules are generally easy to interface with microcontrollers like Arduino or Raspberry Pi, requiring only a 3.3V or 5V power supply, ground, and a digital input pin for the output.
 The detection range for proximity sensors is typically adjustable, ranging from 2 cm to 20 cm, and the detection angle is usually around 35 degrees.
 While effective, these sensors are generally suitable for indoor use and can be affected by ambient light. 


 The STM32F407VG Discovery Kit from STMicroelectronics includes various sensors and peripherals suitable for development, but it does not come with an integrated ultrasonic sensor module like the HC-SR04.
 However, the kit can be used to interface with an external ultrasonic sensor module, such as the HC-SR04, for distance measurement applications.

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor module measures distances from 2 cm to 400 cm with an accuracy of up to 3 mm.
 It operates by sending a 10 microsecond trigger pulse to initiate an 8-cycle burst of 40 kHz ultrasonic waves, then measuring the time it takes for the echo to return.
 This time-of-flight measurement is used to calculate the distance using the formula: distance = (high time × speed of sound in air) / 2.

To use the HC-SR04 with the STM32F407VG Discovery Kit, you can implement a driver library utilizing the STM32's timer input capture functionality to accurately measure the echo pulse duration.
 Libraries are available that provide functions to initialize the sensor, trigger measurements, and read the distance.
 The sensor requires a 5V power supply, which can be managed using the kit's power supply or an external source, and the signal levels may need to be adjusted using level shifters if interfacing with the 3.3V logic of the STM32.

For development, the kit's onboard components, including various sensors and indicator LEDs, provide a comprehensive platform for integrating and testing the ultrasonic sensor. 


The STM32F407G-DISC1 Discovery kit includes a built-in digital microphone, specifically the MP45DT02, located on the board (U9) and not within the STM32F407VG microcontroller itself.
 This microphone is an omni-directional digital microphone, designed for audio input applications.
 The kit's features also include an audio DAC with an integrated class D speaker driver, which can be used for audio output, and the on-board ST-LINK/V2-A debugger/programmer facilitates development and debugging.
 The microphone is part of the kit's comprehensive set of sensors and peripherals, which also includes a MEMS 3-axis accelerometer.
